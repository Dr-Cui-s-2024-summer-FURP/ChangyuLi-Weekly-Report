# Week 2

## Concept learning

continue learned CNN

## Environment building

- [ ] All environments have set up
  - [x] PyTorch
  - [x] PointNet
  - [x] CUDA
  - [x] Issac Sim
  - [ ] [PoseCNN](./PoseCNN.md)

## Replicating

- [ ] PoseCNN
- [x] Pointnet

## Problems
- Lots of my time is used in building PoseCNN

- Since the dependencies for PoseCNN are too old, I might need to create another virtual environment
